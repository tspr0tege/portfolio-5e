    <p><b>Video games</b> - Classic favorites are CastleVania, Megaman X, Final Fantasy, and Zelda. Modern favorites are Soulsborne games, Doom Eternal, and League.</p>
    <p><b>Philosophy</b> - Avid reader and practioner. I like to ponder as much as (if not more than) read on Stoicism, Eastern philosophy, and origins of mythology and religion.</p>
    <p><b>YouTube</b> - I have channels for Gaming and philosophy, and soon to be teaching coding. Nothing big, but they have a few hundred subscribers each.</p>
    <p><b>Books</b> - I read almost exclusively non-fiction in the broad personal development space. Recently I'm getting more into ancient mythos.</p>
    <p><b>Extreme Sports</b> - Skydiving, MMA, aggressive inline, and once I get back in shape: Ninja Warrior. I also have a strange compulsion to climb trees.</p>
