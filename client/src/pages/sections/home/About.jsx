    <p className="aragraph">I'm here to change the course of my destiny.</p>
            
    <p className="aragraph">As a youngling, video games inspired a curiosity about technology that led me to explore programming, networking, and 3D design in High School. After that, circumstances forced me into the job market and I did whatever was immediately available for a long time. Then at nearly 40, with a child getting close to High School I decided I needed to do whatever it took to create a successful path for him and myself.</p>
    
    <p className="aragraph">Once again, my love for video games drove me toward programming, as it blends my passion for complex puzzle solving, creativity, and contributing something that can have exponential impact on people. I angled towards web/software development specifically, as a practical matter.</p>

    <p className="aragraph">So I stopped dabbling and dedicated myself to learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but started to feel like I was spinning my tires and wasn't sure where to go from there. So I enrolled in Hack Reactor. After which I spent my time practicing my "one kick" as Bruce Lee taught, to hone my skills. At the same time I was teaching what I was learning, and have helped several University and boot camp students through their programs as a result. Also taking on projects where I could, while simultaneously dedicating myself to the job search.</p>

    <p className="aragraph">At current, I've been involved with a really impressive machine learning project. Where I was originally brought on full-time, but due to funding issues had to be laid-off. I have, however, agreed to say on (on an equity basis) as the team and the experience have been phenomenal. I've genuinely enjoyed the process of conceptualizing how all the pieces work together and improving/adding to the codebase.</p>
